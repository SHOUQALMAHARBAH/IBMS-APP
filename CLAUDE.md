# CLAUDE.md — ibms-app

This is the first IBMS engineering repo. **Standards, mandatory rules, domain
knowledge, and architecture decisions live in `ibms-brain` (imported above via git
submodule at `ibms-brain/`), not here** — `ibms-brain/meta/lex/` (mandatory),
`ibms-brain/meta/context/` (domain knowledge), `ibms-brain/meta/designs/` (why decisions
were made). Read the relevant `meta/context/` file before touching an area, and the
`meta/lex/` rules before any non-trivial change — most of them (money-decimal-jod,
workflow-state-transitions, maker-checker-segregation, sensitive-data-handling,
pdpl-sla-timers) apply the moment real domain code lands here, which it has not yet.

## Cloning this repo

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SHOUQALMAHARBAH/IBMS-APP.git
# already cloned without it?
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The submodule pins a specific `ibms-brain` commit — it does not auto-track `main`. Pull
in newer brain rules deliberately:

```bash
cd ibms-brain && git pull origin main && cd ..
git add ibms-brain && git commit -m "ibms-brain: sync to latest"
```

## What's here today

Infrastructure only — see root `README.md`. No business logic (policy, claims, CRM,
finance) exists yet.

## Common commands

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d db
npm run db:migrate:dev
npm run dev          # web:3000, api:4000
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test          # vitest, web + api
npm run test:e2e      # api e2e (needs DATABASE_URL reachable)
npm run e2e           # playwright + axe-core, web
```

## Environment

- Node `20.19.0` — see `.nvmrc`. This satisfies Prisma 7's Node floor (≥20.19/22.12/24)
  but Prisma itself stays pinned at `6.19.3` in `package.json` — Node version no longer
  blocks a Prisma 7 install, so don't bump `prisma`/`@prisma/client` past 6.x without
  doing the driver-adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`) + `prisma.config.ts` migration first.
  See the Prisma note in root `README.md`.
- Docker required for Postgres locally and for building `apps/api`/`apps/web` images.

## Before you write code

Same rule as ibms-brain: read `meta/context/` for the area, `meta/lex/` for what's
mandatory, cite the source document (PDPL / CBJ / ISO 27001/27701 / a specific
`PRIV-STD-*`/`PRIV-SOP-*`) in the PR when the change touches a regulatory obligation.
