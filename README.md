# ibms-app

Engineering codebase for **IBMS** (Insurance Brokerage Management System). This is the
first engineering repo for the IBMS build program — a standards-taker from the
`ibms-brain` repo (rules in `meta/lex/`, domain knowledge in `meta/context/`,
architecture decisions in `meta/designs/`), pulled in here as a git submodule at
`ibms-brain/` so both a human and an agent working in this repo actually have it, not
just a note saying to go read it elsewhere. This repo does not restate those rules; it
implements against them. Compliance/PDPL/CBJ obligations still cite the source document
in `ibms-brain/`, not this README.

**Status:** infrastructure scaffold only. No business features (policy, claims, CRM, …)
are implemented yet — see `meta/context/data-model.md` in ibms-brain for the logical
data model this will eventually be built against.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript |
| Backend | NestJS + TypeScript |
| Frontend/backend unit tests | Vitest + Testing Library |
| E2E / accessibility | Playwright + axe-core |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Prisma (`6.19.3` — see note below) |
| Monorepo | npm workspaces + Turborepo |
| Containers | Docker (multi-stage, `turbo prune`-based) |
| CI | GitHub Actions |
| Preview deploys | Vercel (web app only) |
| Production deployment target | **TBD** — not decided yet, do not assume one |

**Why Prisma 6, not 7:** Prisma 7 requires Node ≥20.19/22.12/24 and mandates a driver
adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`) plus a `prisma.config.ts`. Node here is pinned at `20.19.0`
(see `.nvmrc`) — high enough to satisfy tooling engine requirements (e.g.
`typescript-eslint`), but Prisma itself stays pinned at `6.19.3` in `package.json`
deliberately: Node ≥20.19 makes Prisma 7 *installable*, not required. Don't bump the
`prisma`/`@prisma/client` versions past 6.x without doing the driver-adapter + config
migration first. Revisit deliberately when the team moves to Node 22 LTS.

```

`components/`, `features/`, `lib/` (web) and `modules/`, `controllers/`, `services/`,
`repositories/`, `middleware/` (api) are currently empty scaffolding — no business
features exist yet (see Status above). They establish where feature work lands once it
starts, per `meta/context/policy-lifecycle.md` and `meta/context/claims-lifecycle.md` in
`ibms-brain`.

## Prerequisites

- Node `20.19.0` (`nvm use`, or match `.nvmrc`)
- Docker (for Postgres locally, and for building the app images)

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone with the ibms-brain submodule included:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SHOUQALMAHARBAH/IBMS-APP.git
# already cloned without it?
git submodule update --init --recursive

cp .env.example .env
npm install

# Postgres only, for local (non-Docker) app dev:
docker compose up -d db
npm run db:migrate:dev

# Everything else, run natively:
npm run dev
```

- `web` → http://localhost:3000
- `api` → http://localhost:4000 (`/health` liveness, `/health/db` readiness)

Next.js reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars from its own env file for local (non-Docker) dev —
also copy the relevant lines into `apps/web/.env.local` if you're not using
`docker compose` for the whole stack.

### Run the whole stack in Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## `ibms-brain` submodule

`ibms-brain/` is a git submodule, pinned to a specific commit of
[SHOUQALMAHARBAH/IBM-System](https://github.com/SHOUQALMAHARBAH/IBM-System) — it does
not auto-track that repo's `main`. Claude Code (or any agent) working in this repo reads
it automatically via the `@ibms-brain/CLAUDE.md` import at the top of this repo's own
`CLAUDE.md`. To pull in newer brain rules:

```bash
cd ibms-brain && git pull origin main && cd ..
git add ibms-brain && git commit -m "ibms-brain: sync to latest"
```

## Scripts (run from repo root; Turborepo fans them out per workspace)

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | `next dev` + `nest start --watch`, in parallel |
| `npm run build` | Production build of every workspace (`@ibms/db` generates the Prisma client first) |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint, per workspace |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`, per workspace |
| `npm run test` | Vitest unit tests (web + api) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | API e2e tests (Vitest + Supertest) — needs a reachable `DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run e2e` | Playwright e2e + axe-core accessibility checks (web) |
| `npm run db:migrate:dev` | Create/apply a dev migration (`packages/db`) |
| `npm run db:migrate:deploy` | Apply existing migrations, no schema drift (CI/prod) |
| `npm run db:studio` | Prisma Studio |

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

1. **test** — installs, spins up a `postgres:16-alpine` service, runs migrate deploy,
   lint, typecheck, build, unit tests, API e2e tests, then installs Playwright's
   Chromium and runs the web e2e + accessibility suite. Uploads the Playwright HTML
   report as an artifact on every run (including failures).
2. **docker** — builds (does not push) the `api` and `web` images, to catch Dockerfile
   regressions. No registry/push step exists yet — the production deployment target is
   still TBD, so there's nowhere authorized to push to.

## Vercel preview

Not yet connected to a live Vercel project. To wire it up: create a Vercel project from
this repo with **Root Directory = `apps/web`** — `apps/web/vercel.json` already tells
Vercel to install and build from the monorepo root via Turborepo. Set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in the Vercel project's environment variables to wherever the API
is reachable from that preview (there is no hosted API yet, so this is a placeholder
until one exists). The `ibms-brain` submodule isn't needed for the build (it's not an
npm workspace member) and both repos are public, so no submodule-auth setup is required.

## Deployment

**Not decided.** Docker images build correctly and can run anywhere that accepts a
container; nothing here assumes AWS, Azure, Fly, Render, or any other target. Record the
decision in `ibms-brain/meta/designs/` the day it's made, and update this section in the
same change.
