# ibms-app

Engineering codebase for **IBMS** (Insurance Brokerage Management System). This is the
first engineering repo for the IBMS build program — a standards-taker from the
`ibms-brain` repo (rules in `meta/lex/`, domain knowledge in `meta/context/`,
architecture decisions in `meta/designs/`), pulled in here as a git submodule at
`ibms-brain/` so both a human and an agent working in this repo actually have it, not
just a note saying to go read it elsewhere. This repo does not restate those rules; it
implements against them. Compliance/PDPL/CBJ obligations still cite the source document
in `ibms-brain/`, not this README.

**Status:** infrastructure scaffold only. No business features (policy, claims, CRM, …)
are implemented yet — see `meta/context/data-model.md` in ibms-brain for the logical
data model this will eventually be built against.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript |
| Backend | NestJS + TypeScript |
| Frontend/backend unit tests | Vitest + Testing Library |
| E2E / accessibility | Playwright + axe-core |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Prisma (`6.19.3` — see note below) |
| Monorepo | npm workspaces + Turborepo |
| Containers | Docker (multi-stage, `turbo prune`-based) |
| CI | GitHub Actions |
| Preview deploys | Vercel (web app only) |
| Production deployment target | **TBD** — not decided yet, do not assume one |

**Why Prisma 6, not 7:** Prisma 7 requires Node ≥20.19/22.12/24 and mandates a driver
adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`) plus a `prisma.config.ts`. Node here is pinned at `20.19.0`
(see `.nvmrc`) — high enough to satisfy tooling engine requirements (e.g.
`typescript-eslint`), but Prisma itself stays pinned at `6.19.3` in `package.json`
deliberately: Node ≥20.19 makes Prisma 7 *installable*, not required. Don't bump the
`prisma`/`@prisma/client` versions past 6.x without doing the driver-adapter + config
migration first. Revisit deliberately when the team moves to Node 22 LTS.

`components/`, `features/`, `lib/` (web) and `modules/`, `controllers/`, `services/`,
`repositories/`, `middleware/` (api) are currently empty scaffolding — no business
features exist yet (see Status above). They establish where feature work lands once it
starts, per `meta/context/policy-lifecycle.md` and `meta/context/claims-lifecycle.md` in
`ibms-brain`.

## Prerequisites

- Node `20.19.0` (`nvm use`, or match `.nvmrc`)
- Docker (for Postgres locally, and for building the app images)

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone with the ibms-brain submodule included:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SHOUQALMAHARBAH/IBMS-APP.git
# already cloned without it?
git submodule update --init --recursive

cp .env.example .env
npm install

# Postgres only, for local (non-Docker) app dev:
docker compose up -d db
npm run db:migrate:dev

# Everything else, run natively:
npm run dev
```

### Dev DB vs. test DB

Two separate local Postgres instances, never the same database:

- **`db`** (dev) — `docker compose up -d db`, driven by `.env`. Only changes when you
  explicitly run a migrate command against it. This is the database `npm run dev` talks to.
- **`db-test`** — `docker compose up -d db-test`, driven by `.env.test` (copy from
  `.env.test.example`). Everything exploratory happens here first: schema changes and
  `npm run test:e2e` run against this database, never against `db`.

```bash
cp .env.test.example .env.test
docker compose up -d db-test

# Iterate on a schema change and run the integration suite against db-test:
npm run db:test:migrate:dev
npm run test:e2e

# Once you're satisfied, promote the same migration files to the dev DB:
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

`db:test:migrate:dev` and `db:migrate:deploy` apply the same migration files under
`packages/db/prisma/migrations/` to different databases — nothing is copied or
regenerated between them, only re-applied. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) does the
equivalent against its own ephemeral `ibms_test` container, which is destroyed with the
runner at the end of the job — it never touches either local database.

- `web` → http://localhost:3000
- `api` → http://localhost:4000 (`/health` liveness, `/health/db` readiness)

Next.js reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars from its own env file for local (non-Docker) dev —
also copy the relevant lines into `apps/web/.env.local` if you're not using
`docker compose` for the whole stack.

### Run the whole stack in Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## `ibms-brain` submodule

`ibms-brain/` is a git submodule, pinned to a specific commit of
[SHOUQALMAHARBAH/IBM-System](https://github.com/SHOUQALMAHARBAH/IBM-System) — it does
not auto-track that repo's `main`. Claude Code (or any agent) working in this repo reads
it automatically via the `@ibms-brain/CLAUDE.md` import at the top of this repo's own
`CLAUDE.md`. To pull in newer brain rules:

```bash
cd ibms-brain && git pull origin main && cd ..
git add ibms-brain && git commit -m "ibms-brain: sync to latest"
```

### `.claude/` — agents, commands, hooks

Claude Code only discovers `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, and `.claude/settings.json`
at a session's own project root — not inside a nested git submodule — so this repo carries
its own `.claude/` rather than relying on `ibms-brain/.claude/`:

- `.claude/agents/{code-reviewer,software-developer}.md`, `.claude/commands/brain-gap.md` —
  mirrored from `ibms-brain/.claude/{agents,commands}/` by
  `.claude/hooks/mirror-brain-agents.sh` (a `PostToolUse` hook on Write/Edit). Don't hand-edit
  these files — the hook overwrites drift on the next Write/Edit.
- `.claude/settings.json` wires two of `ibms-brain`'s `PreToolUse` hooks directly against the
  submodule path (`enforce-credential-safety.sh`, `enforce-workspace-updates.sh`).
  `enforce-evidence.sh` (the `git push` evidence gate) is deliberately **not** wired yet —
  `scripts/verify.sh` doesn't write `artifacts/<sha>/gates.json`, so turning that hook on
  today would block every push with no way to satisfy it. The domain-code hooks
  (`enforce-money-decimal.sh`, `enforce-state-transitions.sh`, `enforce-sensitive-data.sh`)
  are also not wired — moot until real domain code lands (see `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Known gap:** both wired hooks parse the tool-call JSON via `python3`. On a machine where
  `python3` resolves to a stub (e.g. the Windows Store alias, with a real interpreter only at
  `python`), they silently no-op instead of blocking — verified during setup. This is a
  pre-existing issue in `ibms-brain`'s hook scripts, not something this repo can fix on its
  own.

## Scripts (run from repo root; Turborepo fans them out per workspace)

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | `next dev` + `nest start --watch`, in parallel |
| `npm run build` | Production build of every workspace (`@ibms/db` generates the Prisma client first) |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint, per workspace |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`, per workspace |
| `npm run test` | Vitest unit tests (web + api) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | API integration tests (Vitest + Supertest) — needs a reachable `DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run test:contract` | API contract tests — validates real responses against the OpenAPI schema generated from `@nestjs/swagger` decorators (`apps/api/test/contract.contract-spec.ts`) — needs a reachable `DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run test:security` | Dependency audit (`npm audit --audit-level=high`), repo-wide |
| `npm run test:smoke` | `bash scripts/smoke.sh api` — dispatches to the api service's smoke test (see below) |
| `npm run e2e` | Playwright functional e2e (web) — excludes `@a11y`-tagged specs |
| `npm run test:a11y` | Playwright + axe-core accessibility checks (web) — only `@a11y`-tagged specs |
| `npm run db:validate` | `prisma validate` — schema is internally valid (not a drift check; that's `db:migrate:status`) |
| `npm run db:migrate:dev` | Create/apply a migration against the dev DB (`packages/db`) |
| `npm run db:migrate:deploy` | Apply existing migrations to the dev DB, no schema drift (also used for CI/prod) |
| `npm run db:migrate:status` | Check dev DB migration history against `schema.prisma` for drift |
| `npm run db:test:migrate:dev` | Create/apply a migration against `db-test` — where schema iteration happens |
| `npm run db:test:migrate:deploy` | Apply existing migrations to `db-test`, no schema drift |
| `npm run db:test:migrate:status` | Check `db-test` migration history against `schema.prisma` for drift |
| `npm run db:studio` | Prisma Studio (dev DB) |

## `scripts/`

- **`scripts/smoke.sh <service>`** — dispatches to a single backend service's smoke
  test. Today that's just `api` (`bash scripts/smoke.sh api`), which boots the real
  service via `npm run start` and calls `/health` and `/health/db` — proving it can
  reach Postgres, not just that the process started. Add a `case` for a second service
  the day one exists; see `apps/api/scripts/smoke.sh` for what a real per-service smoke
  test looks like.
- **`scripts/verify.sh`** — runs every gate in `ibms-brain/meta/context/verification-contract.md`
  § Backend/frontend gate commands against `db-test` and prints each gate's real evidence
  (exit code, and a test count where the tool reports one), ending in a summary block.
  Precondition: `.env.test` exists (`cp .env.test.example .env.test`) and `db-test` has
  been migrated at least once (`npm run db:test:migrate:dev`). Run it before opening a PR
  to get the evidence block for the PR description in one shot — claims aren't evidence,
  this is.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, three jobs:

1. **frontend** — installs, then: typecheck → lint → unit/component tests (Vitest +
   Testing Library) → installs Playwright's Chromium → accessibility (`test:a11y`,
   axe-core, `@a11y`-tagged specs, evidence is 0 serious/critical violations) → e2e
   (`e2e`, functional Playwright flows) → build. Uploads the Playwright HTML report as an
   artifact on every run (including failures).
2. **backend** — installs, then: typecheck → lint → unit tests → security (`test:security`
   — dependency audit) → spins up an ephemeral `postgres:18-alpine` service container
   (database `ibms_test`, ports/network scoped to the job — distinct from both local
   `db` and `db-test`, and destroyed with the runner when the job ends) → database schema
   (`db:validate` — `prisma validate`, schema is internally valid) → migrate deploy →
   schema-drift check (`db:migrate:status`, fails on drift) → integration tests
   (`test:e2e`) → contract tests (`test:contract`, OpenAPI-validated responses) → smoke
   tests (`bash scripts/smoke.sh api` — boots the real service and hits `/health` +
   `/health/db`) → build.
3. **docker** — builds (does not push) the `api` and `web` images, to catch Dockerfile
   regressions. No registry/push step exists yet — the production deployment target is
   still TBD, so there's nowhere authorized to push to.

### First end-to-end verification

Confirmed 2026-08-25 via `chore/initial-ci`, the repo's first real PR: every gate above
runs and passes on a clean diff, and a deliberately broken unit test correctly blocks
the PR (red ❌) until reverted. This is what makes `definition-of-done.md` mechanically
enforced rather than documentation.

## Vercel preview

Not yet connected to a live Vercel project. To wire it up: create a Vercel project from
this repo with **Root Directory = `apps/web`** — `apps/web/vercel.json` already tells
Vercel to install and build from the monorepo root via Turborepo. Set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in the Vercel project's environment variables to wherever the API
is reachable from that preview (there is no hosted API yet, so this is a placeholder
until one exists). The `ibms-brain` submodule isn't needed for the build (it's not an
npm workspace member) and both repos are public, so no submodule-auth setup is required.

## Deployment

**Not decided.** Docker images build correctly and can run anywhere that accepts a
container; nothing here assumes AWS, Azure, Fly, Render, or any other target. Record the
decision in `ibms-brain/meta/designs/` the day it's made, and update this section in the
same change.
